## Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze the correlation between significant economic events and various economic indicators such as unemployment rates, consumption patterns, and wages/benefits. By focusing on major events like the 2008 housing market crash and the COVID-19 pandemic, we seek to uncover patterns and insights that can inform future economic predictions and policy-making.

## The project utilizes multiple datasets to conduct the analysis:
Unemployment Data: Includes historical unemployment rates across different periods, including the 2008 housing market crash and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Wages and Benefits Data: Information on average wages, benefits, and compensation over time in the private industry.
Consumer Price Index (CPI): Data on various components of the CPI, providing insight into consumer price changes.

## Objectives
Correlation Analysis: To find correlations between unemployment, consumption, and wages/benefits with significant economic events.
Trend Identification: To identify trends and patterns in economic indicators before, during, and after major economic events.
Predictive Insights: To develop insights that could help predict future economic downturns or recoveries.

## Methodology
Data Collection: Gather data from reliable sources such as government databases, financial institutions, and historical records.
Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify outliers, and determine initial insights.
Correlation Analysis: Use statistical methods to find correlations between different variables and significant economic events.
Visualization: Create visualizations to represent the findings clearly and intuitively.
Reporting: Compile the results into a comprehensive report that highlights key findings and insights.
